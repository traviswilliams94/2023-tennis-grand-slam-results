## Description

Welcome to the 2023 Tennis Grand Slam Results Library! Birthed from the fact that I have to do a python project for Flatiron School and we are also in the second week of Wimbledon.

With this app you can:

1. Search a player's name and get alist of their results for each of this year's Grand Slam Tournaments and well as Indian Wells. (US Open will be added after the tournament occurs)

2. Search by Tournament name and see the 1st and second place players along with the other semi-finalists

3. Search by tournament result and see the  player(s) that have that result each tournament

## Database Schema

We have 3 databases:

player.py - contains player name, ranking at the time this was created, and gender

tournament.py - contains simply the tournament name

results.py - associating the best players and the result they achieved at each tournament

## Generating Your CLI

A CLI is, simply put, an interactive script. You can run it with `python cli.py`
or include the shebang and make it executable with `chmod +x`. It will ask for
input, do some work, and accomplish some sort of task by the end.

Past that, CLIs can be whatever you'd like. An inventory navigator? A checkout
station for a restaurant? A choose-your-adventure video game? Absolutely!

Here's what all of these things have in common (if done well): a number of
`import` statements (usually _a lot_ of import statements), an `if __name__ ==
"__main__"` block, and a number of function calls inside of that block. These
functions should be kept in other modules (ideally not _just_ `helpers.py`)

There will likely be some `print()` statements in your CLI script to let the
user know what's going on, but most of these can be placed in functions in
other modules that are grouped with others that carry out similar tasks. You'll
see some variable definitions, object initializations, and control flow
operators (especially `if/else` blocks and `while` loops) as well. When your
project is done, your `cli.py` file might look like this:

```py
from helpers import (
    function_1, function_2,
    function_3, function_4,
    function_5, function_6,
    function_7, function_8,
    function_9, function_10
)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('Welcome to my CLI!')
    function_1()
    x = 0
    while not x:
        x = function_2(x)
    if x < 0:
        y = function_3(x)
    else:
        y = function_4(x)
    z = function_5(y)
    z = function_6(z)
    z = function_7(z)
    z = function_8(z)
    function_9(z)
    function_10(x, y, z)
    print('Thanks for using my CLI')

```
